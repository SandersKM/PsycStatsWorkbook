# What is the average real anual earnings in 1975?

# What is the average real anual earnings in 1978?


# What is the median age of participants

# What is the median real anual earnings in 1974?

# What is the median real anual earnings in 1975?

# What is the median real anual earnings in 1978?


# What is the skew age of participants

# What is the skew real anual earnings in 1974?

# What is the skew real anual earnings in 1975?

# What is the skew real anual earnings in 1978?


# What is the skew age of participants

# What is the skew real anual earnings in 1974?

# What is the skew real anual earnings in 1975?

# What is the skew real anual earnings in 1978?
